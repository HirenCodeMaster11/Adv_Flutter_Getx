## Description :
```A Flutter counter app is a simple application that displays a numeric value on the screen, which can be incremented or decremented by tapping respective buttons. The app typically features a central counter display, along with buttons labeled "+" for interaction. The app's state management ensures that the counter value updates dynamically in response to user actions. It is a common introductory project for learning the basics of Flutter, including widget usage, state management, and UI building. The app is often built using a stateless or stateful widget structure.```

## Description :
```In Flutter, you can use GetX for efficient state management during CRUD operations. To display the data, wrap the ListView.builder inside an Obx widget to observe changes in the data. Each item in the list can be rendered using ListTile wrapped in a Card widget for better styling. Use controller methods for adding, updating, and deleting items, updating the state with update(). Fetch the list data in the controller and display it in the ListView.builder by iterating over the list. This setup allows dynamic UI updates based on CRUD operations.```
